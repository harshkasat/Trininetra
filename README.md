# Trininetra

Trininetra is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired individuals through advanced camera integration. This application provides several features aimed at enhancing the independence and mobility of blind users by detecting objects, estimating distances, recognizing faces, and providing textual descriptions.

## Features

### Object Detection and Distance Estimation
Trininetra utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to detect objects in the environment captured by the device's camera. It provides real-time feedback to the user about the objects present in their surroundings and estimates the distance to those objects, helping them navigate safely and independently.

### Near Object Detection
The application helps users find objects in close proximity based on verbal instructions. By interpreting the user's commands, Trininetra scans the nearby area and provides feedback to help locate desired objects efficiently.

### Facial Recognition System
Trininetra incorporates a facial recognition system that identifies individuals within the camera's view. This feature assists users in recognizing familiar faces, enhancing social interactions and personal safety.

### Word Description Functionality
Trininetra offers a word description functionality that verbally describes the visual scene to the user. By leveraging advanced image processing and natural language generation, the application provides detailed descriptions of objects, people, and surroundings, enabling users to better understand their environment.
